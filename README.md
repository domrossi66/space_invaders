# Space Invaders

This is a copy of the game Space Invaders coded in with the raylib library in C++.

The raylib project starter from Programming With Nick can be found [here](https://github.com/educ8s/Raylib-CPP-Starter-Template-for-VSCODE-V2). The sprites and font are provided by him as well. Music and sound effects were composed by [Teo Lympero](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/63245).

This game is completely functional. Although I have added details such as a level display and a highscore, these features are misleading as there is only one level. Perhaps you reading this would like to download and add these things, or you can just enjoy the bare bones game I made to continue learning C++.
